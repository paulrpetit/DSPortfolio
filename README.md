_“First this: God created the Heavens and Earth—all you see, all you don’t see. Earth was a soup of nothingness, a bottomless emptiness, an inky blackness. God’s Spirit brooded like a bird above the watery abyss. God spoke: ‘Light!’ And light appeared.”_

## Experiment Design and Statistical Modeling
1. **A Perfect Match: The Effect of Dating App Profile Attributes on Match Rate** \[[paper]()\] \[[deck]()\] 
 * _tl;dr_: If you care to improve your match rate with 22 to 32 year-old heterosexual Bay Area women on the popular dating app, Hinge, during the most prolific pandemic of the century, don't lie (or tell the truth) about having graduated from a prestigious university (UC Berkeley, in particular). _Do_ try to get a high-caliber job (especially as a data engineer at Google). Don't worry about being prosocial (ie. counseling foster you). (Read the paper for a discussion of the premises this tl;dr rests on.)

2. **Reducing Crime in North Carolina** \[[paper]()\] 
  * _tl;dr_: Demographic and regional factors have a significant impact on crime rates in North Carolina. Policies reducing the severity of punishment for crime and increasing the probability of arrest are likely to have the greatest impact on crime rate. Creative policies to stymie the destructive interference of density and poverty likely could have significant impact on reduction in crime. Responding effectively to crime requires far more nuanced approach than deployment of police in areas of high crime.
  
## Applied Machine Learning
1. **Housing Price Predictions in Ames, Iowa** \[[notebook]()\] \[[deck]()\]  
  * _tl;dr_: a blended (70% ridge regression +30% XGB regressor) model achieves 11.6% error rate on Ames, Iowa housing price test data (top 17% in Kaggle competition).

### Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning 
1. **Named Entity Recognition and Sentiment Analysis on President Trump’s Tweets to Test a Simple Stock Trading Strategy** \[[paper]()\] \[[deck]()\]
  * _tl;dr_: We find that, despite modest precision in the entity recognition task, strong recall allows us to recognize 82% of the organizations in our test set. Our best sentiment analysis model, a convolutional neural network, scored an 81% accuracy rate. Applying our trading strategy, we netted a 5% and 2% gain on Amazon and Google stock, respectively, and lost 3% on Facebook trading Trump’s sentiment as compared with a buy-and-hold strategy.

### Machine Learning at Scale
1. **Predicting Flight Delays using Weather Data** \[[notebook]()\]
  * _tl;dr_: Gradient-boosted trees, which are amenable to parallelization, offered the best accuracy (80% F1-score) on predicting whether or not a flight would be weather delayed. We propose including our model in an ensemble of models that forecasts flight delays based on weather forecasts to improve scheduling.

## Python for Data Science
1. **Why We're Moving to Jupyter: An Exploratory Analysis of the Relationship between Housing Prices and Evictions in the U.S. with Python** \[[paper]()\] \[[deck]()\] 
  * _tl;dr_: Regions where home ownership was relatively expensive weren't necessarily less affordable for renters. Expensive home ownership resulted in higher rental rate but wasn't associated with higher eviction rate. Between 2009-11, changes in rent were not positively correlated with changes in eviction rate. Changes in income also didn’t have the expected inverse relationship with eviction rate.

## Research Design and Applications for Data and Analysis
1. **Visual Storytelling through "The Strength of Absent Ties: Social Integration via Online Dating"** \[[deck]()\]
