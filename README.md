A collated pantry of sweet, sweet data and savory analyses prepared by the precocious insight chef, Paul Petit (et al.)

Welcome! You're currently in the master branch of this repo, the foyer of my data science portfolio. Please don't stop here. The festivities are just through this door, on the `portfolio` branch hidden to the search engine queries of future students of the masters program for which I completed many of these projects. [Please come in](https://github.com/paulrpetit/DataSciencePortfolio/tree/portfolio).
